## Features:
- Multiple half-duplex gateways
- 1% radio duty cycle for uplink transmissions
- 1 or 10% radio duty cycle for downlink transmissions
- Two receive windows (RX1, RX2) for ACKs and commands
- Non-orthogonal SF transmissions
- Capture effect
- Path-loss signal attenuation model
- Multiple channels
- Collision handling for both uplink+downlink transmissions
- Proper header overhead
- Node energy consumption calculation (uplink+downlink)
- ADR (Tx power adjustment)

## Usage:
```
perl generate_terrain.pl terrain_side_size_(m) num_of_nodes num_of_gateways > terrain.txt
perl LoRaWAN.pl packets_per_hour simulation_time(secs) terrain.txt
```

### Example with 1000x1000m terrain size, 100 nodes, 5 gateways, 1pkt/5min, ~3h sim time:
```
perl generate_terrain.pl 1000 100 5 > terrain.txt
perl LoRaWAN.pl 12 10000 terrain.txt
```
